- 👋 Hi, I’m @arm-ARMY
- 👀 I’m interested in arm architectures, Linux, Raspberry Pi, BSD, cybersecurity and many others...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create a nice terminal based interfaces to apps that needs long commands and many typing things to work.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing and translating some projects.
